- 👋 Hi, I’m @JoaoCampagnolo
I am a newly graduated student from the University of Lisbon, having recently undergone a research fellowship at EPFL for my Master thesis 
project on unsupervised behavioral classification from Drosophila melanogaster 3D pose data. My research endeavor was carried out with commendable 
results, allowing me to co-author a paper “DeepFly3D, a deep learning-based approach for 3D limb and appendage tracking in tethered, adult Drosophila”, 
published in eLife magazine.
Presently, I am eager to further pursue my education within a research setting, as I am motivated by both the implicated engagement with scientific 
challenges and the honorable contribution to progress.

- 👀 I’m interested in Biomedicine in general, with a penchant for neuroscience, particularly for its behavioral and computational branches. In parallel, I'm also fond of exploring the etiology of neuropathologies through novel machine learning applications.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about unsupervised learning techniques within a Python setting.
